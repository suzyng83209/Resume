# CV made from compilation of different templates
Using `cv-roald-example` and `fancy-cv`, this Tex document is a modern layout which provides a good platform for presenting resume information 

# Style Guide:
> “Everything is designed. Few things are designed well.”
1. Simple is KEY: 
  Employers that do scan resumes do so very quickly. The easier they can pick out key information, the better.

2. Black and White or Colour: Black and White

3. Side Column? While side columns are a point of debate in many resumes across the internet, for the current state of my technical ability and experience, side columns offer the most clean and space-saving solution to quickly list off key skills and experiences.
